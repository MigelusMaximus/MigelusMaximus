# Migelus Maximus

**` ≈†ikulko≈°√°k `**

Right now I am not yet a skillfull fellow, but rather a person ready to learn tons of new skills and ready to gather lots of experience.
I am currently learning and leaning towards "Basic Web Development" as well as an easy python programming, but i am hoping to learn lot more in future.
Also I am really focused on self development and "outside profession" hobbies and skills.
